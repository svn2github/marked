## Committers

Committers are contributors who also have the responsibility, privilege, some might even say burden of being able to review and merge contributions (just usually not their own).

- Tony Brix @UziTech - really good at the test harness and environment setup
- Federico Soave @Feder1co5oave - really good at the regex things
- Steven @styfle

Committers are usually selected from contributors who enter the discussions regarding the future direction of Marked (maybe even doing informal reviews of contributions despite not being able to merge them yourself).

## Admins

Admins are committers who also have the responsibility, privilege, and burden of selecting committers and making sure the project itself runs smoothly, which includes community maintenance, governance, dispute resolution, and so on. (Letting the contributors easily enter into the project and begin contributing, with minimal friction.)

## Publishers

Publishers are admins who also have the responsibility, privilege, and burden of publishing the new releases to NPMJS and performing outreach and external stakeholder communications. Also, when stuff goes pear-shaped, we're the ones who take the most heat. (Admins are focused primarily on the internal workings of the project, Publishers are focused on internal *and* external issues.)
