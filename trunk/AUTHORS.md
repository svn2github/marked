# Authors

Marked takes an encompassing approach to its community. As such, you can think of these as [concentric circles](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951), where each subsequent group is enveloped by the previous one.

## Users

Users are anyone using Marked in some fashion, without them, there's no reason for us to exist.

To be listed: please let us know or submit a PR.

To be removed: please let us know or submit a PR.

## Contributors

Contributors are users who submit a [PR](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/pulls), [Issue](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues), or collaborate in making Marked a better product and experience for all the users.

## Committers

Committers are contributors who also have the responsibility, privilege, some might even say burden of being able to review and merge contributions (just usually not their own).

A note on "decision making authority". This is related to submitting PRs and the [advice process](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making). The person marked as having decision making authority over a certain area should be sought for advice in that area before committing to a course of action.

To be listed: Committers are usually selected from contributors who enter the discussions regarding the future direction of Marked (maybe even doing informal reviews of contributions despite not being able to merge them yourself).

To be removed: You can remove yourself through the [GitHub UI](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-yourself-from-a-collaborator-s-repository/).

## Admins

Admins are committers who also have the responsibility, privilege, and burden of selecting committers and making sure the project itself runs smoothly, which includes community maintenance, governance, dispute resolution, and so on. (Letting the contributors easily enter into, and work within, the project to begin contributing, with as little friction as possible.)

To be listed: Admins are usually selected from the pool of committers who demonstrate good understanding of the marked culture, operations, and do their best to help new contributors get up to speed on how to contribute effectively to the project.

## Publishers

Publishers are admins who also have the responsibility, privilege, and burden of publishing the new releases to NPMJS and performing outreach and external stakeholder communications. Further, when things go pear-shaped, they're the ones taking most of the heat. Finally, when things go well, they're the primary ones praising the contributors who made it possible.

(In other words, while Admins are focused primarily on the internal workings of the project, Publishers are focused on internal *and* external concerns.)

<h2 id="badges">Badges</h2>

Badges? You don't *need* no stinkin' badges. 

Movie references aside. (It was either that or, "Let's play a game", but that would have been creepy&hellip;that's why it will most likely come later.)

If you *want* 'em, we got 'em, and here's how you get 'em (and&hellip;dramatic pause&hellip;why not two dramatic pauses for emphasis?&hellip; how they can be taken away).

1. Add the appropriate badge to the desired contributor in the desired column, even if they're not listed here yet.
2. Submit a PR (we're big on PRs around here, if you haven't noticed, help us help you).
3. Follow the instructions for submitting a badge PR. (There are more details to find within.)
