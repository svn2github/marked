	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, "That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to."

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, "Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well." That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying no is hard for most humans ("people pleasers") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, "Thank you" or "Here's what my status is" in the community or "Hey, I think something's wrong here" in a civil manner.
